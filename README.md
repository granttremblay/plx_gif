Creating an animation demonstrating astronomical parallax in [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language))

Posted originally in [this](http://www.ifweassume.com/2012/07/parallax.html) blog post in 2012, updated in 2014. Re-discovered and code made open in 2018.

## Requires:
- IDL (used version 7.0, newer probably works) to render the images as .eps files
- [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) to `convert` from IDL's normal .eps files to single .gif files
- [gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) to render .gif images into an animated GIF


Note: Now I would do this via Python, but I would *probably* render it still using gifsicle...
